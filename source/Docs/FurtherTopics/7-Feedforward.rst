Feedforward
###########

Following paths consistently with only PID can be difficult. Adding 
feedforward can make tuning a lot easier and faster. Check out
the WPILib `article <https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software
/advanced-controls/controllers/feedforward.html>`_ about feedforward 
for more information. For advice on combining feedforward and PID, check
out this `article <https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/
advanced-controls/controllers/combining-feedforward-feedback.html>`_.
