Sensor Customization
********************

Rotor Encoder
=============

FRC teams often use the `CTRE CANCoder <https://store.ctr-electronics.com/cancoder/>`_
for measuring the angle of the rotor. It is a great sensor but it can be a bit expensive. 
Thus, teams with a tighter 
budget can consider using the `Thrifty Absolute Magnetic Encoder 
<https://www.thethriftybot.com/bearings/Thrifty-Absolute-Magnetic-Encoder-p421607500>`_. 
This encoder uses the same mount as normal CANCoders, but comes at a much cheaper price.

IMU
===

Additionally, teams must have an IMU on the robot to measure the angle of the robot. Popular 
IMU choices include the `Pigeon <https://store.ctr-electronics.com/pigeon-2/>`_ and 
`navX <https://www.andymark.com/products/navx2-mxp-robotics-navigation-sensor>`_ IMUs.
